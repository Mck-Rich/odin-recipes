        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lasagna is a classisc Italian dish made up of layers of pasta, meat, cheese, and sauce, baked together to create a rich, comforting meal. Traditionally, it consists of wide, flat sheets of pasta layered with fillings such as ground beef, pork, or a mix of the two, along with a savory tomato-based marinara sauce. In addition to the meat sauce, a creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese mixture is often included to add richness and flavor.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Heat 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet or pan over medium heat.
                    Add 1 lb of ground beef (or a mixture of beef and pork). Break it apart with a spoon or spatula as it cooks.
                    Season with salt and pepper, and cook until browned and no longer pink, about 7-10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add 1 medium chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
                    Stir in 2-3 minced garlic cloves and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
                    
                <li>Stir in 2 cups of tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon of tomato paste, and 1 can (14.5 oz) of crushed tomatoes.
                    Add 1 teaspoon each of dried oregano and dried basil.
                    If desired, pour in 1/4 cup of red wine for extra depth of flavor and let it simmer for 2-3 minutes.
                    Simmer the sauce on low heat for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, and 1 teaspoon of sugar (optional) if needed.</li>
